# BaseInjectInternalSDK - Where all internal projects start

**IMGUI/KIERO/DX11 READY**

Important files that you need to read, understand, change:

- globals.h
- imguisettings.h
- framework.h
- imgui_menu.cpp
- dllmain.cpp

## Advantages of using this base
- directx 11 ready
- imgui ready with a menu
- inject & eject without breaks (all is clean before exiting)
- CG ready to use, just place the sdk files and sdk.h

## Read all the code, so you can fully understand everything
>**P.S - If you have some doubts, just read the code, its self explanatory**
